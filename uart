Ps: cmd_rdy is rdy in the UART_rx
Receiver: UART_RX

Input:

Clk, rst_n
RX: data get from BLE112 (the blue box on the right)
clr_rdy: asserted to knock down the cmd_rdy signal. 

Output:
rdy : asserted when a byte has been received 
cmd[7:0]: byte received (serves as command to follower)

Transmitting: UART_TX

Input: 
clk, rst_n
trmt: assert for 1 clock to initiate transmission
tx_data[7:0]: byte to transmit

Output:
TX: data output
tx_done: Asserted when byte is done transmitting, Stays high (tx_done = 1) still next  byte       transmitting;
